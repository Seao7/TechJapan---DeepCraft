# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze stock market data, preprocess it, and build models for predicting stock price movements. The project consists of three main Jupyter notebooks: 

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Training**

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.11 or above installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the stock market dataset, including data visualization and summary statistics.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- This notebook covers the preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, scaling features, and creating new features for model training.

### 3. Model Training
- This notebook implements various machine learning models and evaluates their performance on the dataset. It includes both regression and classification approaches.

## Usage

You can run each notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab). Make sure to follow the order of the notebooks for a better understanding of the workflow.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the challenges of stock market prediction and highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and feature engineering. Further improvements and refinements are needed to enhance model performance.
